# SDP QuickCheck

SDP QuickCheck contains Arbitrary instances for SDP structures.

## Reasons

QuickCheck depends on containers, array (implicitly) and template-haskell.
No matter how useful this library is, it makes sdp heavier and cannot remain its
dependency.

## Versioning

sdp-quickcheck follows of the [Haskell PVP](https://pvp.haskell.org) and SDP
extension rules.
